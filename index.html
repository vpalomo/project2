			<p> Rihanna and Kylie Jenner are both very popular celebrities who have big fan bases. Kylie Jenner is a multi-millionaire reality Tv star and Rihanna is a multi-millionairesinger. They both started makeup lines mostly unexpected, at least for me. The reason I say unexpected is because I never really knew that Kylie Jenner or Rihanna was every that into makeup. I also feel that since they are probably the most popular celebrity makeup lines, they are put to competition. As soon as Fenty Beauty was released, people immediately started comparing the products and the sale to Kylie Jenner's. Fenty Beauty has overall more useful products in the makeup line and Rihanna has suited almost everything for every type of skin color.  </p>
