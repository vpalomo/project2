			<p> Rihanna released her long awaited makeup line back in September 8 of 2017. It instantly began to catch up to Kylie Jenner’s makeup line “Kylie Cosmetics” and beat kylie’s sales by 5 time in the first month. In the second month, Fenty Beauty was beating Kylie Cosmetics by 34 percent, according to Bazar.  Fenty beauty hadn’t even been out for that long and it wa already doing better than KylieCosmetics. People loved the fact that Fenty beauty had so many different shade ranges (40 to be exact) and the fact that she created her makeup to look good on basically everyone and all skin colors. The Fenty foundation is mattefying and mainly for oily skin. It also has good coverage and sinks into the skin seamlessly. A lot of people, including myself praise Fenty for being made for every skin color
