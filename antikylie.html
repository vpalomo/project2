			<p> Kylie released her first Kylie Lip Kits in November of 2015. Her $29 lip kits were an instant success with the website going sold out. Since then she has changed the name to Kylie Cosmetics and has sold $630 million worth of makeup. The makeup line has also come out with other makeup products since their very firsts lip kits. Kylie has released things like makeup lattes, highlighters, blush, concealers and more. The concealers did have a decent shade range and had pretty good shades for people of color, but it wasn’t one of the most popular products. Her eyeshadow palettes have been sent to different people on Kylie’s PR list and several people have reviewed them in youtube videos. In her most recent eye makeup palette, her Halloween collection. Her shade range in this palette was very dull and very basic. The colors also lacked a lot of pigment when swatched and applied to the eyes. The very first eye makeup palette was a collection of her favorite eyeshadows and she basically said that it was made for her and for her preference. She was hoping that other people would enjoy the eyeshadow colors that she likes, unlike Rihanna, where she creates all of the lipglosses, highlighters, eyeshadows, and matchsticks specially made to look good on everyone and every skin tone. Kylie has also said in a video where her and Jordyn Woods, a woman of color, were trying on some of Kylie’s lip kits that she chose one of her lip colors because she liked the way it looked on herself. But Jordyn Woods said that she did not like the way that color looked on her.</p>
